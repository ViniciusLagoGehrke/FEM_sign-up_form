## The challenge

This challenge was to build out an introductory component and get it looking as close to the original design as possible.

Users are able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

**What I learned and praticed In this challenge besides the basic of HTML, CSS and JavaScript:**

-FORM tag on HTML with label, input, ul and li tags.

-input attributes including placeholder and required.

-JS adEventListener(), preventDefault(), and string.trim()

-Validation with inputs are blank

-Email validation with REGEX
